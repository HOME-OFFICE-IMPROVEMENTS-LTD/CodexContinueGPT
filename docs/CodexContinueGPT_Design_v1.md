# 🧠 CodexContinueGPT v1 – Design Blueprint

This is the foundational design document for **CodexContinueGPT v1** — the intelligent AI-powered assistant layer for developers, deployed inside CodexContinue.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

Enable context-aware development assistance using:
- Persistent memory
- Intelligent agent orchestration
- LLM-optimized prompting
- Internal tools and long-term skill retention

---

## 🧩 Architecture Overview

### 🧠 Brain Modules
- `MemoryManager`: Session + long-term history
- `PromptBuilder`: Constructs system + user prompts
- `ToolRouter`: Chooses tools (e.g., OpenAI, Ollama, CLI)
- `FeedbackAnalyzer`: Evaluates user sentiment/feedback
- `CommandExecutor`: Securely runs shell commands if allowed

### 🪄 Chat Workflow (Conceptual)
1. User sends input
2. Context retrieved → memory + history
3. Prompt constructed → routed to LLM
4. Result stored → optionally executed
5. Feedback loop collected

---

## �� Plugin Support (Future v1.5+)

- [ ] Python Plugin Registry (like LangChain Tools)
- [ ] Auto-loading `.agent` or `.plugin` files from `/agents/` dir
- [ ] Tool usage stats

---

## 💡 Recommendations (by CodexGPT)
- Keep brain modules pure, testable, reusable
- Persist user memory using JSON + optional SQLite fallback
- Build plugins as classes with `run()` method
- Allow toggling verbosity + debugging at runtime
- Embrace user feedback and offer real-time fixes

---

## 🚀 Goals by v1 Milestone
- [x] Brain memory layer working
- [ ] Prompt assembly system added
- [ ] Tool routing logic scaffolded
- [ ] Streamlit + API hybrid interface
- [ ] Feedback + Telemetry stubs added
