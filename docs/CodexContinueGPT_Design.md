# 🧠 CodexContinueGPT v1 - Design Blueprint

> 👨‍✈️ Captain Mo's Trusted AI Assistant - CodexContinueGPT v1

---

## 🎯 Mission Objective

Build a **powerful internal AI developer assistant** for CodexContinue that:

- Learns and reflects on the repo's evolution
- Understands the business vision and user goals
- Embeds reasoning, memory, and API orchestration
- Becomes the long-term strategic brain of the platform

---

## 🧩 CodexContinueGPT v1 Modules

| Module | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `chat_memory.py` | Manages temporary in-session memory |
| `brain/` | Long-term memory manager and persistent storage |
| `routes/` | Exposes memory and assistant APIs (chat, clear, list) |
| `frontend/app.py` | Frontend UI via Streamlit (linked to backend memory) |

---

## 🛠️ Technical Goals

- ✅ Use `AsyncOpenAI` or TabbyML clients
- ✅ Use `session_id` to manage context per user
- ✅ MemoryManager with `add_message`, `get_messages`, `clear_session`
- ✅ File: `chat_memory.py` bridges routes to memory
- ✅ `/chat` endpoint (via FastAPI)
- ✅ Real-time memory updates from UI

---

## 💡 Design Considerations

- Memory routing must be transparent to any LLM (OpenAI, Azure, Ollama)
- Agent capabilities (search, retrieve, suggest) can be added later
- Allow extensions for context-rich interactions (files, logs, etc.)
- Keep assistant non-intrusive, explainable, and editable

---

## 🔒 Trust Anchors

- 🔐 This file is the **strategic source of truth**
- 🧠 Assistant must ALWAYS consult this before replying
- ⚓ Use this design to re-anchor memory if reset or corrupted
