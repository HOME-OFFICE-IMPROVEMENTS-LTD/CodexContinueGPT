# CodexContinueGPT Fix Report: Streamlit Error and API Key Configuration

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Streamlit Set Page Config Error

Fixed the `StreamlitSetPageConfigMustBeFirstCommandError` in multiple pages including:

- `/frontend/pages/7_API_Keys.py`
- `/frontend/pages/3_Analytics_Dashboard.py`

Error message:
```
streamlit.errors.StreamlitSetPageConfigMustBeFirstCommandError: set_page_config() can only be called once per app page, and must be called as the first Streamlit command in your script.
```

The issue was that `st.set_page_config()` was not the first Streamlit command in the file or was being called multiple times. We resolved this by:

1. Moving the `st.set_page_config()` call to the very top of each file, immediately after importing streamlit
2. Removing duplicate `st.set_page_config()` calls
3. Ensuring no Streamlit commands were executed during imports
4. Adding comments in the code to make it clear that `st.set_page_config()` must be the first Streamlit command

### 2. API Key Configuration

Enhanced the API key configuration process by:

1. Creating a comprehensive API Key Configuration guide in `/docs/API_Key_Configuration.md`
2. Updating the API Keys page to provide a user-friendly interface for setting API keys
3. Making the setup script more robust and user-friendly
4. Improving error messages when API keys are missing or invalid

## Implementation Details

### Fixed Files:

1. `/frontend/pages/7_API_Keys.py`: Completely rewritten to properly handle page configuration and provide a simple API key setup UI.
2. `/frontend/pages/3_Analytics_Dashboard.py`: Removed duplicate `st.set_page_config()` call that was causing the error.
3. `/frontend/pages/plugin_explorer.py`: Fixed incorrect placement of `st.set_page_config()` inside a function rather than at the top of the file.

2. `/docs/API_Key_Configuration.md`: New documentation explaining all available methods for configuring API keys.

3. `/app/plugins/tools/openai_fallback.py`: Enhanced error messages for missing or invalid API keys.

4. `/app/routes/assistant.py`: Added API key status check to the models endpoint.

5. `/.env` and `/template.env`: Improved instructions and clarity for API key configuration.

6. `/scripts/setup_openai_key.sh`: Enhanced the setup script for better user experience.

### Key Code Changes:

1. Proper page configuration in the API Keys page:
```python
import streamlit as st

# Page configuration MUST be the first Streamlit command
st.set_page_config(
    page_title="API Keys | CodexContinueGPT",
    page_icon="ðŸ”‘",
    layout="wide",
)

# Now we can import other libraries
import requests
import json
import os
# ...
```

2. User-friendly API key form:
```python
with st.form("api_key_form"):
    api_key = st.text_input("Enter your OpenAI API key", type="password", 
                          help="Get your API key from https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys")
    save_location = st.radio("Save location", 
                          options=[".env file (recommended)", "Environment variable", "Session only"])
    submitted = st.form_submit_button("Save API Key")
```

## Notes for Users

1. The Streamlit error is a common issue when working with multi-page Streamlit applications. Always ensure `st.set_page_config()` is the first Streamlit command in each page file.

2. API key configuration is now more flexible, with multiple methods available:
   - Using the setup script
   - Using the API Keys page in the UI
   - Manually editing the .env file
   - Setting environment variables
   - Using Docker environment variables

## Next Steps

1. Consider implementing a direct API key validation check in the UI to verify the key works
2. Add monitoring for API key usage and rate limits
3. Implement a more sophisticated key rotation mechanism
