# 🧠 CodexContinueGPT v1 - Architecture and Plan

---

## 🎯 Purpose
CodexContinueGPT v1 is the first **memory-augmented AI developer assistant** designed to:
- Support multi-session memory (Short + Long Term)
- Allow easy switching between different LLM providers (OpenAI, Azure, Ollama)
- Provide a solid API backend for chatbots, extensions, or SaaS apps
- Be self-hosted, local-first, scalable to cloud
- Prioritize clean, modular, and hackable code

## 🧱 Project Core Components

| Component          | Description |
|--------------------|-------------|
| Memory Manager     | Store, retrieve, and manage conversations per session |
| Storage Layer      | Easily switch between in-memory, Redis, database |
| API Router         | `/chat`, `/memory`, `/status` endpoints (clean and simple) |
| LLM Gateway        | Unified wrapper for OpenAI, Azure, Ollama |
| Frontend (Streamlit)| Fast prototyping front for easy testing |

---

## 🧠 Memory Strategy
- ✅ Default: **In-Memory Storage**
- ✅ Pluggable: **Upgrade to Redis/Postgres later**
- ✅ Multi-session: Store multiple chats per user
- ✅ API Endpoints:
  - `POST /chat` ➔ send message + retrieve response
  - `GET /memory/{session_id}` ➔ retrieve history
  - `DELETE /memory/{session_id}` ➔ clear session

---

## 🤖 LLM Strategy
- ✅ Start with **OpenAI GPT-3.5 Turbo**.
- ✅ Abstract LLM calls via a **single service**.
- ✅ Support for **multiple providers** (Ollama, Azure, Github Enterprise Copilot).
- ✅ Easy to add **Anthropic, Cohere, Mistral** later.

---

## 🚀 Frontend
- ✅ Simple Streamlit app for local testing.
- ✅ Later: Optional React, Vercel UI for production.
- ✅ Chat interface with history replay.

---

## 🧹 Clean Code & Structure
- `/app/routes/` ➔ FastAPI endpoints
- `/app/services/` ➔ LLM, Memory Managers
- `/app/brain/` ➔ Special utilities
- `/app/memory/` ➔ Different memory storage implementations

---

## 🛡️ Security & Best Practices
- API keys read securely from `.env`
- Input validation (Pydantic or manual)
- Avoid leaking secrets in errors
- Ready for containerization (Docker)

---

## 📈 Future Expansions
- Workspace memory (files + chats per user)
- Organization multi-tenant SaaS
- OpenTelemetry for tracing
- Plug in fine-tuned models
